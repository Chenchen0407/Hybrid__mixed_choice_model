# Hybrid Mixed Choice Model for EMV Battery-Swapping Services

This GitHub repository houses the implementation of a Hybrid Mixed Choice model in R, developed to analyze user preferences and willingness to pay for battery-swapping services in Electric Micro-Mobility Vehicles (EMVs). The model is built utilizing stated preference (SP) survey data.

## Overview

With EMVs becoming an increasingly prevalent solution to urban congestion, energy consumption, and air pollution, challenges such as charging difficulties, range anxiety, and battery management have arisen. Current research predominantly focuses on traditional charging methods, leaving a gap in our understanding of alternative solutions like Battery-Swapping Services (BSS). This repository aims to bridge this knowledge gap.

## Repository Structure

- `Code/`: Includes all the R scripts related to data preprocessing, Hybrid Mixed Choice model implementation, data visualization, etc.
- `Data/`: Contains the SP survey datasets used in this project.
- `Results/`: Houses the outputs from the Hybrid Mixed Choice model and data analysis.
